When I tried to get out, it broke again. My roommate had to come and help me get out of thebed. Then the bed could not be put back in the couch. I have had a hip replacement. Sitting on that sofa bed with a broken frame that fell in could have caused damage to my hip. And, that was not all the curtains in the room were too short to cover the entire window so there was light in the room all night. The last straw was that the room had a hair dryer that would not stay on while in use. I had to hold the on button to use the dryer, which made it totally useless. Our stay was not a good experience. I have stayed in Best Western Hotels all over the US and never used one with this many problems. When I asked for a reduction in my charge, I was given only a 20, instead of a no charge for the room. I would not have been so disgruntled had the owner, Sarah Patel, given me a free night, but she did not. The hotel furniture was dangerous, did not have the wet bar that it promised, and did not have appropriate window coverings. Sarah Patel, owner of the establishment, provided (1) poor services, (2) unsafe equipment and (3) inoperable appliances. Her business tarnishes the image of Best Western Hotel International and the city of Tracy.view less",Never Stay Here,drmbyrd

I have never written a review on anything in my life but I have to say something so nobody else has a horrible stay at Seaside. The hotel is as tacky as it gets. Stuffed animals everywhere. The AC didn't work and we couldn't sleep! The towels in the bathroom looked like they were 10 years old! The place smelled like a nursing home. We couldn't get out of there fast enough. If we could of gotten our money back we would of changed hotels. We stayed in the Jungle room which meant they put about 50 stuffed animals over the bed and hung monkeys from the ceiling. My two year old thought is was cool but my husband and I were annoyed! I understand they were trying to go with a theme but it was very tacky! Please do yourself a huge favor and stay somewhere else!

The bus was small and very comfortable, reclining seats, air conditioning, lots of leg room and space for day packs. Anything bigger just couldn't get to the places we visited; along tiny, twisting Irish back roads (So glad I didn't drive). The guide/driver was a fountain of knowledge, treating everyone as his new best friend. Stories and info flowed easily and I never felt like I was receiving a lecture.

From the relatively tranquil settings of the hotel pools you can pop through an exclusive turnstile straight into Meditterania and enjoy all the fun of what has to be the best theme park outside of Florida. The hotel is immaculately kept with the quaint look of a Mediterranean village and offers acres of outdoor space to stretch out and soak up the sun although, like most hotels it fails to provide enough shade and parasols are scarce. The rooms have recently been renovated and there's free Wi-Fi in all areas (as at July 2014). In the neighbouring theme park there's an amazing variety of rides and shows to suit everyone. The main gripe is the lack of decent food in any of the restaurants. With the exception of Rac de Mar near the entrance we experienced cold, bland and overpriced dishes at all of the restaurants in addition to poor service. At The Iron Horse Hotel and the Steak House we could not distinguish between any of the meats served. Most of it tasted like I cooked it - which isn't great!

Sutton Bay is a Beautiful resort and we have found it to be extremely family friendly, clean and affordable.

They (management) have devoted their life to this cause and this is clearly evident. We look forward to many more memories at Sutton Bay and it is our opinion that any negative postings came to be as a form of retaliation from a person or persons that either had trouble following the simple rules or were refused service for a valid reason, almost always for the protection or consideration of the other guests.

We had not been to Sicily before and this was an excellent base for exploring several parts of the island - including some beautiful sites, all the more so for being decked in spring flowers. The Greek temples at Selinunte and Segesta were especially impressive as were the Roman mosaics at Piazza Armerina, although it was almost 3 hours drive over the mountains in the centre of the island to the latter. We also very much enjoyed the food - the seafood was excellent (even if ultimately disappointing in Porticello, where much is landed from the boats). There are several good restaurants near the hotel including La Brasiera and (more expensively) La Caseta de la Nonna. In short, we can't wait to return to Sicily and visit some other areas. The hotel very much suited our needs, and as part of a package deal (with flights and hire car) was very good value. Driving around Palermo is quite challenging and we advise full insurance cover as it is rare to see a car without scratches down the side. Top tip: make sure you have a map to the hotel from the airport or a sat nav as without this (as we discovered in a torrential rain storm) it is very hard to find your way around the outskirts of Palermo with its many one-way streets. The hotel has secure parking (at an extra cost) and rooms have air conditioning or heating. Careful if you leave your windows open as there are Mosquitos (in the spring at least).",Comfortable hotel on outskirts of Palermo,A Traveler

The hotel is across the Lake from Bellagio which is a short boat ride away and there are restaurants and pizzerias within a short walk of the hotel in either direction. Also the hotel is directly next door to the Villa Carlotta (a stately house and botanical gardens, well worth a visit). However the Hotel decor has not changed at all since our last visit 8 years ago, and it is showing. The rooms were sparsely decorated, the shower leaked everywhere and the TV was the oldest, grainiest model I've seen in years. The breakfast restaurant commanded beautiful views of the lake but the food was seriously lacking in quality. The bacon was greasy and the sausages looked ominous. They had prossecco available to drink though and had a wonderful tasting coffee and hot chocolate machine. The waiters were all dressed in fine uniforms that although smart looked as though they were designed in the 40's. The whole hotel needs a kick into the modern day. But all in all, we had a wonderful stay and we would recommend this hotel to everyone we meet.

When we first got to the room there was no hot water. They did fix it however. There is also a weird musty smell in the room and throughout the hotel. Even with opening the sliding glass door it did not go away. It's probably because the hotel is so old and there is no exhaust fans in the bathrooms so the steam really gets going in be rooms. The walls and ceilings are paper thin so you can hear every door closing and everything that goes on around you. The hotel has been updated so don't let the hotel so old statement rub you the wrong way. The pool area and hot tub is extremely nice and well kept and the bar and bartender at the pool is a highlight of the property. One last issue is that you have to pay for parking with a hotel stay....ridiculous in my book! Again though for the price of the room it was a good deal and worked for what I needed.,Great Price Weird Smell,Frank

The staff was exceptionally willing to assist at every opportunity. Ski in and out with ease - true 'resort skiing.' The hot pool was excellent after a day off the top of Lone Mt. I'd go on about the great skiing but it was no better than epic (except for the January snow fall of 2014). We had a great time.,Ski trip while visiting MSU,A Traveler

To top it off the house behind us had a dog which could hear you once you walked into the bathroom (the window was open) and would bark endlessly. Way overpriced too.

This was our first condo rental and we couldn't be more pleased. We have 3 kids and wanted something more than a hotel. It was roomy and comfortable with 2 bedrooms and a sleeper couch. Sure beats trying to find a hotel with room for five. The condo was very clean and well kept. It felt like being at home. Kids liked the pool and there were baby ducks that came up from the river there everyday. TV's in every room so the kids didn't fight over what to watch. Master bedroom was fantastic with a jacuzzi tub. Location was convenient and Elk Springs was responsive to any needs we had. We look forward to trying one of the cabins next time as a change of pace.,,Scott F.
